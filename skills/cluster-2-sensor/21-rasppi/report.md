#  Raspberry Pi

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-10-03

## Summary

In this skill my team and I demonstrated setting up a Raspberry Pi zero and then using it as a server to run a Node program. We used Raspbian Lite as an OS and SSHed into the Pi after connecting it to a WiFi network configured by the instructor. Using a deploy key, we downloaded a Node script I had written to display "HELLO WORLD!" on port 8080. In the future, we can interface with the ESP32 to create a wireless sensor for collecting data.

## Sketches and Photos

Here is an image of completed Rasbian flash to the Raspberry Pi:

Here is an image of the web server running from the Pi:

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution

* I used the [Node tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_http.asp) to create the web server.
