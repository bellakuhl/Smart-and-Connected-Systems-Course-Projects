#  CanvasJS

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-10-07

## Summary
In this skill, I used CanvasJS to graph data inputted from a text file with data separate by commas. The data inputted was stock info for Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook. I used the multiseries chart from CanvasJS to design the chart.

## Sketches and Photos

Here is an image of the chart I generated:

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution

* I referenced [CanvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/multi-series-line-chart/) for the chart template and example usage.
* I referenced [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_filesystem.asp) to write the JavaScript.
