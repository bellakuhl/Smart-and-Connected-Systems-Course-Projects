#  Using the USB Webcam on the Raspberry Pi Zero

Author: Isabella Kuhl, Laura Reeve, Joseph Rossi, 2019-12-2

## Summary

In this skill we use Motion to live stream from a webcam to a server hosted at 192.168.1.108 on port 8081. Streaming the webcam will allow us to remotely control the crawler using the server. One issue we ran into was the framerate of the stream using a Pi Zero was choppy and slow. We will consider upgrading to a Raspberry Pi 3B in order to have a more stable stream to drive with.

## Sketches and Photos

Here is an image of the webcam stream:
