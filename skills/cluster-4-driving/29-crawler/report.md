Author: Isabella Kuhl, Laura Reeve, Joseph Rossi 2019-10-30

## Summary

For this quest we wrote a simply program that cycles through the different
directions in which the crawler's ESC and steering servos can be controlled.
After flashing the, the ESC will calibrate the ESC, then cycle the ESC through
the following sequence with 3 second delays in-between each step:

1. ESC Forward
2. ESC Stop
3. ESC Backward
4. ESC Stop
5. Steering Left
6. Steering Right
7. Steering Center.

The program is then finished.
