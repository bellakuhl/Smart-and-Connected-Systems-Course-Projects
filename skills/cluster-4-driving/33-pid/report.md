#  PID Control Using the Micro

Author: Isabella Kuhl, Joseph Rossi, Laura Reeves, 2019-11-02

## Summary

In this skill we implemented a PID feedback control system to detect the distance of an object and calculate the difference between the measured and desired distance. We used the microLIDAR sensor to calculate distance and three LEDs to indicate the error value. If the measured distance was to high the red LED turned on, too low and the blue one turned on, and if equal to the desired distance, the white LED turned on. This demonstrated control system will be the same system used to control wheel speed on the crawlers.

## Sketches and Photos

We took a video to demonstrate this skill which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PrP6xBrVcw0hf8MAarGWIpkhqMi9iNTz).

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution

* We referenced the provided class [design template](http://whizzer.bu.edu/briefs/design-patterns/dp-pid) for PID control.
* We referenced Medium's article on [PID control](https://medium.com/luosrobotics/an-introduction-to-pid-control-with-dc-motor-1fa3b26ec661) for background information on PID control.
