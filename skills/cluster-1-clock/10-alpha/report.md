#  Alphanumeric Display

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-09-19

## Summary
In this skill I wrote a program that accepted an input from the user and then displayed it on an alphanumeric display. The display only writes four characters so the program only uses and displays the first four characters inputted by the user. After another set of data is entered it overwrites the current display with the new input, clearing unused display spots by displaying a blank.

## Sketches and Photos
Here are two images of YES and NO being displayed on the alphanumeric display:

[Emily Lam's](https://github.com/BU-EC444/code-examples/tree/master/i2c-display) code for initializing UART and the display were used and adapted in my program.
