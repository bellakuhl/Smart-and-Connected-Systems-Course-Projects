#  Console I/O

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-09-19

## Summary
In this skill I implemented a program that has three modes. The first mode, toggle, toggles the on board LED when "t" is inputted. The second mode, echo, writes the string or character inputted by the user. The last mode is hex, which converts the inputted integer to a hex and prints it.

## Sketches and Photos
Here is an image of the console read-out when the program is running:
