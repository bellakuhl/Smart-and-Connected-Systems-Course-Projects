# Use GPIO to Drive LEDs

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-09-12

## Summary
In this skill I used Atom to write a program that counts up to 15 in binary using four LEDs. I did this by wiring up the LEDs with a 220 Ohm resistor to get the correct current to the LEDs given the ESP supplies 3.3v. I then wrote the program using an array of binary values and set the output value to each LED as the bit in the binary code.

## Sketches and Photos
Here is an image of 14 in binary running on the ESP32:

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution
Huzzah image of ESP32 pinout was used for reference
Hello_world example code template was used as a shell for the program I wrote
