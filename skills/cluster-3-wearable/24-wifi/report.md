#  WiFi

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-10-15

## Summary
In this skill I set up the ESP32 to use WiFi. I used the ESP WiFi Station example to configure and connect the ESP to my team's router. I then went to the router's settings to make sure the ESP was connected

## Sketches and Photos

Here is an image of the ESP32 connected to the router:
