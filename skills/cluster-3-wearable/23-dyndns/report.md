#  Dynamic DNS

Author: Isabella Kuhl, 2019-10-10

## Summary
In this skill we set up a DNS so that we are able to change the location of the router and still access it. We used the Raspberry Pi as a server and used port forwarding to forward requests to port 80 to the Pi which hosted the .js file to listen and display text on port 80. We used a Namecheap domain that a team member had already purchased for the DDNS which updated the IP address of the router.
