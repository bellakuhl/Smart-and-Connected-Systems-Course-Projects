# Smart-and-Connected-Systems-Course-Projects

**This is a collection of projects completed for an IoT course Fall 2019. The course description is as follows:**


Hands-on introductory course to cyber-physical and IoT systems. Microcontrollers: integrated development environments (ISEs), architecture, and I/O interfaces. Hardware interfacing of systems: formal design and specifications, real-time OS, programming, and control. IoT systems: smart phones, wireless personal area networks (WPANs), IP gateways, mobile cloud computing, reliability, security, and privacy.


I took this course my senior year of my undergrad studies at Boston University. I've included these projects on my github profile because this course gave me a strong introduction to many parts of IoT systems. My intention with this is to continue to improve upon my code structure and understanding of embedded systems with the work in this course as a baseline.

** A decription of the assignment is in the summary portion of the reports for each skill**
